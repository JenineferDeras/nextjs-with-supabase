# Shell Script Path Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
All shell scripts in this repository contained hardcoded absolute paths specific to one user's machine:
```bash
cd /Users/jenineferderas/Documents/GitHub/nextjs-with-supabase
```

This caused the scripts to fail when:
- Run by different users
- Run in CI/CD environments
- Run from different working directories
- Deployed to production environments

## Solution Implemented
Replaced all hardcoded paths with dynamic directory resolution using the standard bash pattern:

### For scripts in repository root:
```bash
# Get the directory where this script is located and navigate to repository root
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"
```

### For scripts in subdirectories (scripts/, notebooks/):
```bash
# Get the directory where this script is located and navigate to repository root
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/.."
```

## Scripts Fixed
### Root directory (12 scripts):
- `setup_abaco_environment.sh`
- `git-cleanup.sh`
- `emergency-fix.sh`
- `cleanup_and_sync.sh`
- `complete-cleanup-and-commit.sh`
- `fix_all_build_issues.sh`
- `fix_environment.sh`
- `post-cleanup-verification.sh`
- `run_financial_analysis.sh`
- `sync_all_changes.sh`
- `sync_and_merge.sh`
- `sync_repository.sh`

### Subdirectories (3 scripts):
- `scripts/cleanup-repository.sh`
- `notebooks/verify_supabase.sh`
- `notebooks/cleanup_repository.sh`

## Additional Fixes
Removed hardcoded user home directory references:
- Removed `rm -f /Users/jenineferderas/package-lock.json` (cleanup_and_sync.sh)
- Removed `rm -f /Users/jenineferderas/pnpm-lock.yaml` (multiple scripts)

## Benefits
✅ Scripts now work from any location
✅ Works in CI/CD environments (GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build, etc.)
✅ Works for all users regardless of their system paths
✅ Maintains the same functionality
✅ More maintainable and portable

## Testing
All scripts have been tested and verified to:
1. Correctly locate the repository root
2. Execute without path-related errors
3. Work from different working directories

## Usage
Simply run any script from anywhere:
```bash
# From repository root
./setup_abaco_environment.sh

# From any subdirectory
../setup_abaco_environment.sh

# Using absolute path
/path/to/repo/setup_abaco_environment.sh
```

All scripts will automatically navigate to the correct directory.
