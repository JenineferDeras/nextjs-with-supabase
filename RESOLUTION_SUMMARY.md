### 3. Solutions Provided

For each reported issue, the documentation now provides:

#### Issue 1: Access Permissions
**Solutions in `docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md` and `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**:

1. **Request Access from Project Owner**:
   ```bash
   # Via Cloud Console → Request Access dialog
   # Or contact owner directly
   ```

2. **Create Your Own Project**:
   ```bash
   gcloud projects create YOUR-PROJECT-ID
   gcloud config set project YOUR-PROJECT-ID
   ```

3. **Check Current Permissions**:
   ```bash
   gcloud projects list
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT-ID
   ```

#### Issue 2: API Enablement
**Solutions in `docs/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md` and `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**:

1. **Enable via CLI**:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable dataproc.googleapis.com
   ```

2. **Enable via Console**:
   - Click the link in error message
   - Click "Enable API"

3. **Enable All Required APIs**:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com \
       cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
       dataproc.googleapis.com
   ```

#### Issue 3: Git Upstream Configuration
**Solutions in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**:

1. **Set Upstream and Push**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Configure Default Behavior**:
   ```bash
   git config --global push.default current
   ```

3. **Set Branch Tracking**:
   ```bash
   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
   ```
